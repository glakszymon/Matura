# Google Apps Script Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

Your Google Apps Script code wasn't getting all the data because there were several mismatches between your JavaScript client code and the Google Apps Script backend. Here's what I identified and fixed:

### 1. **Missing spreadsheetId Parameter in GET Requests**
**Problem**: Your JavaScript client was calling GET endpoints without passing the required `spreadsheetId` parameter.

**Fix**: Updated all GET requests in `js/googleSheets.js` to include the spreadsheetId:
```javascript
// Before
const url = `${this.config.GAS_WEB_APP_URL}?action=getCategories`;

// After  
const url = `${this.config.GAS_WEB_APP_URL}?action=getCategories&spreadsheetId=${encodeURIComponent(this.config.SPREADSHEET_ID)}`;
```

### 2. **Missing Action Handlers**
**Problem**: Your JavaScript client was calling several actions that didn't exist in your Google Apps Script:
- `getAnalyticsData` (client) vs `getAnalytics` (GAS)
- `getCategoriesBySubject` - missing entirely
- `getMainEntries`, `getCategory`, `getSubject`, `getMainEntry` - missing
- `deleteCategory`, `deleteSubject`, `deleteMainEntry` - missing

**Fix**: Added all missing handlers to the updated Google Apps Script, including proper aliases for existing functionality.

### 3. **Data Structure Inconsistencies**
**Problem**: The default data returned by GAS had inconsistent field names:
- Sometimes using `subject_name`, sometimes `name`
- Sometimes using `category_name`, sometimes `name`  
- Missing `id` fields for proper identification

**Fix**: Updated default data functions to include both field name variations for backward compatibility:
```javascript
// Updated to include both naming conventions
{ id: 'subj_1', subject_name: 'Matematyka', name: 'Matematyka', color: '#FF6B6B', icon: 'üìê', active: true }
```

### 4. **Legacy Form Support**
**Problem**: Your app supports both new StudyFlow format and legacy form format, but the GAS wasn't handling this properly.

**Fix**: Added proper detection and handling of both form types:
- `formType: 'main'` ‚Üí routes to legacy main form handler
- `formType: 'task'` ‚Üí routes to StudyFlow task handler
- Auto-detection when formType is not specified

### 5. **Improved Error Handling**
**Problem**: Poor error handling when parameters were missing or malformed.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing event object or parameters
- Missing spreadsheetId
- Invalid data formats
- Sheet access issues

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Update Your Google Apps Script
1. Go to your Google Apps Script project: https://script.google.com
2. Replace your entire script with the content from `updated-gas-script.js`
3. Save and deploy the script

### Step 2: Test the Integration
1. Start your local development server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Open http://localhost:8000
3. Try the following operations to test:
   - Fetch subjects and categories (should now work)
   - Add a new category or subject
   - Submit a form entry
   - Check analytics data

### Step 3: Verify Your Sheet Structure
Make sure your Google Sheets has the following sheets with proper headers:

#### Tasks Sheet
Headers: `task_name | category | subject | correctness | timestamp | points | session_id`

#### Subjects Sheet  
Headers: `id | name | description | active`

#### Categories Sheet
Headers: `id | name | description | active`

#### Achievements Sheet
Headers: `achievement_id | name | description | icon | type | target_value | points_reward | unlocked | unlock_date`

#### Pomodoro_Sessions Sheet
Headers: `session_id | start_time | end_time | duration_minutes | category | subject | points_earned | status`

#### Settings Sheet
Headers: `setting_key | value | type | description`

#### User_Stats Sheet
Headers: `date | tasks_completed | correct_tasks | points_earned | pomodoro_sessions | study_time_minutes`

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Comprehensive Action Support**: All JavaScript client methods now have corresponding GAS handlers
2. **Better Parameter Validation**: Proper checking for required parameters
3. **Dual Data Format Support**: Works with both legacy and new data formats
4. **Enhanced Analytics**: Combines data from multiple sheets for comprehensive analytics
5. **Proper ID Generation**: Auto-generates IDs for new entries
6. **Soft Deletes**: Categories and subjects are marked inactive instead of deleted
7. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for existing main form functionality

## Testing the Fixed Integration

You can test specific functions manually in the Google Apps Script editor:
- `testDoGet()` - Test GET request handling
- `testDoPost()` - Test POST request handling  
- `testEmptyParameters()` - Test error handling

The updated script includes comprehensive logging to help with debugging if issues persist.

## Configuration Notes

Your current configuration in `js/config.js` looks correct:
- `SPREADSHEET_ID`: '1a51kwcG8aT4rfTSdhJ6HKSggneURQkQsywZClCcIcJ8'
- `GAS_WEB_APP_URL`: 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby8CSl_CeZG3oMlLu4hvRZNoJsrDSMmnOsIyiTFXr2qnKl9t3bB2njVy8hWlu3P_dU/exec'

Make sure your Google Apps Script deployment URL matches the one in your config.

The fixes should resolve the data retrieval issues you were experiencing. The integration now properly handles all the functionality your StudyFlow application requires.
