# Quick Fix Guide - Google Apps Script Error

## üö® Current Issue
The app is trying to load data from Google Sheets but getting the error:
```
API returned error: Error: Main form sheet not found
```

This means your Google Apps Script hasn't been updated with the new version yet.

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Step 1: Update Google Apps Script
1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Open your existing script project
3. **Replace all the code** with the content from `updated-gas-script.js`
4. **Save the script** (Ctrl+S)
5. **Deploy the script** (click "Deploy" > "New deployment")
   - Type: Web app
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone
6. **Copy the new deployment URL** and update it in `js/config.js` if needed

### Step 2: Verify Your Google Sheet Structure
Make sure your Google Sheet has these sheets with the correct headers:

#### Subjects Sheet:
```
id | name | description | active
```

#### Categories Sheet:
```
id | name | description | active
```

#### Main Form Sheet (Arkusz1):
```
nazwa | tresc | poprawnosc | kategorie | przedmiot | timestamp
```

### Step 3: Test the Loading Screen
1. **Refresh your app** at http://127.0.0.1:8081
2. You should see the beautiful loading screen with progress steps
3. Each step should turn from ‚è≥ to ‚úÖ as data loads
4. The app should show the dashboard with real data from your sheets

## üéØ What's Fixed in the New Version

1. **Loading Screen**: Beautiful full-screen loading with real-time progress
2. **Error Handling**: App continues to work even if some data fails to load
3. **No More Preloaded Data**: Everything comes from your Google Sheets
4. **Better Debugging**: Individual component initialization with error catching

## üîß Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Loading Screen**: Working
- ‚úÖ **App Initialization**: Working
- ‚úÖ **Component Loading**: Working with graceful error handling
- ‚è≥ **Google Sheets Connection**: Waiting for script update
- ‚è≥ **Data Loading**: Will work once script is updated

The app structure is now solid - just needs the Google Apps Script update to connect to your data!
